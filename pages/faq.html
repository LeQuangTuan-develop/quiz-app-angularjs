                    <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default,
                    until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
                    element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and
                    hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding
                    our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within
                    the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
